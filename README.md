## *Project Overview*
This study analyzed Kickstarter funding campaigns from 2007 to 2017 to determine which factors drive successful campaigns.

## *Purpose* 
The purpose of this report is to inform the user of these factors and to assist in creating the strategy that is most likely to be effective for a theater campaign.

## *Analysis and Challenges*
This analysis isolated just the theater campaigns in the United States for evaluation. By analyzing effects of the campaign launch date, goal amount, category, and other factors, characteristics of successful campaigns were derived. Some challenges in evaluating this data were the broad range of funding goals and currencies that impede some side-by-side comparisons.

### *Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date*
A clear trend emerged from the analysis that shows that most successful theater campaigns are launched in May. The graph below further depicts this trend, showing that successful campaigns peak at the beginning of the summer, then fall to a bottom in December. However, it should also be noted that more than a third of campaigns are launched during the summer. Therefore, it is also important to the proportion of successful campaigns.

### *Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals*
The correlation between goal amount and success rate is less obvious, with a subtle negative trend across most of the graph (pictured below). However, as the funding goal amount approaches the upper bound of the range, near $50,000, a sharp decline in successful campaigns occurs.

### *Challenges and Difficulties Encountered*
The data used span the globe, but this study examined only campaigns in the United States. This study would have had not have had such a robust data set were it to have been focused on less wealthy nations. This issue could have been addressed by expanding the sample to include neighboring nations’ statistics in the analysis.



## *Results*
This analysis shows several factors that play a substantial role in the success or failure of a Kickstarter campaign. Campaigns launched in the summer are more likely to be successful than their winter-launched counter parts. The month of May had both the greatest number of successful campaigns launched, and the highest proportion of successful campaigns. The graph below shows the proportion of successful, failed and canceled campaigns, by month.

While the success rate does show loose negative correlation to the funding foal, goals between $10,000 and $40,000 have much less variance in success rate than do goals at either end of the spectrum. While funding goals under $1,000 have success rate near 70.0 percent, goals over $50,000 are less than 20.0 percent likely to succeed. In contrast, goals in the $5,000-$9,999 range and goals in the $35,000-$39,999 range were both roughly 47.0 percent likely to succeed.

*1.) What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?*
- Most successful campaigns are launched in May and the summer months, while December struggles with the lowest success rate.
-While the number of successful campaigns varies greatly throughout the year, following a distinct cycle, the proportion of successful campaigns varies much less.

*2.) What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?*
-Campaigns that set goals significantly less than the median goal are considerably more likely to be successful than campaigns that set goals significantly above the median. Between the first and third quartile of the data set, variance is much more limited but still shows a downward trend.

*3.) What are some limitations of this dataset?*
-The dataset offers very little insight on several factors that could have meaningful impacts on the outcomes and amounts raised. The geographic data only identifies the country where the funding will be used, but not the city, or neighborhood. Demographics, local preferences and even the accessibility of the venue could all be hidden variables that our analysis overlooked. The dataset also fails to consider the genre of the play, the experience of the organizer and the quality of the cast. While the “blerb” column offers some insights, it would be extremely tedious to extract the relevant information.

*4.) What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?*
-It was helpful to add the graph showing the proportion of successful campaigns to add color the analysis on outcomes by date.
